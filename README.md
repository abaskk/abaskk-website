My personal website: https://amruthbaskar.info/

A fullstack website with authentication and an admin page for me to add information on the fly (which you can't access). The frontend utilizes React, Tailwind and the backend is a simple Express API. The app is deployed on EC2 using docker containers and an nginx reverse proxy.
